    @ApiOperation(value = "Create a node", nickname = "createNode", notes = "**Note:** this endpoint is available in Alfresco 5.2 and newer versions.  Create a node and add it as a primary child of node **nodeId**.  This endpoint supports both JSON and multipart/form-data (file upload).  **Using multipart/form-data**  Use the **filedata** field to represent the content to upload, for example, the following curl command will create a node with the contents of test.txt in the test user's home folder.  ```curl -utest:test -X POST host:port/alfresco/api/-default-/public/alfresco/versions/1/nodes/-my-/children -F filedata=@test.txt```  You can use the **name** field to give an alternative name for the new file.  You can use the **nodeType** field to create a specific type. The default is cm:content.  You can use the **renditions** field to create renditions (e.g. doclib) asynchronously upon upload. Also, as requesting rendition is a background process, any rendition failure (e.g. No transformer is currently available) will not fail the whole upload and has the potential to silently fail.  Use **overwrite** to overwrite an existing file, matched by name. If the file is versionable, the existing content is replaced.  When you overwrite existing content, you can set the **majorVersion** boolean field to **true** to indicate a major version should be created. The default for **majorVersion** is **false**. Setting  **majorVersion** enables versioning of the node, if it is not already versioned.  When you overwrite existing content, you can use the **comment** field to add a version comment that appears in the version history. This also enables versioning of this node, if it is not already versioned.  You can set the **autoRename** boolean field to automatically resolve name clashes. If there is a name clash, then the API method tries to create a unique name using an integer suffix.  You can use the **relativePath** field to specify the folder structure to create relative to the node **nodeId**. Folders in the **relativePath** that do not exist are created before the node is created.  Any other field provided will be treated as a property to set on the newly created node.  **Note:** setting properties of type d:content and d:category are not supported.  **Note:** When creating a new node using multipart/form-data by default versioning is enabled and set to MAJOR Version. Since Alfresco 6.2.3 **versioningEnabled** flag was introduced offering better control over the new node Versioning.  | **versioningEnabled** | **majorVersion** | **Version Type** | |-----------------------|------------------|------------------| |        unset          |        unset     |    MAJOR         | |        unset          |        true      |    MAJOR         | |        unset          |        false     |    MINOR         | |        true           |        unset     |    MAJOR         | |        true           |        true      |    MAJOR         | |        true           |        false     |    MINOR         | |        false          |        true      |    Unversioned   | |        false          |        false     |    Unversioned   | |        false          |        true      |    Unversioned   | <br>  **Using JSON**  You must specify at least a **name** and **nodeType**. For example, to create a folder: ```JSON {   \"name\":\"My Folder\",   \"nodeType\":\"cm:folder\" } ```  You can create an empty file like this: ```JSON {   \"name\":\"My text file.txt\",   \"nodeType\":\"cm:content\" } ``` You can update binary content using the ```PUT /nodes/{nodeId}``` API method.  You can create a folder, or other node, inside a folder hierarchy: ```JSON {   \"name\":\"My Special Folder\",   \"nodeType\":\"cm:folder\",   \"relativePath\":\"X/Y/Z\" } ``` The **relativePath** specifies the folder structure to create relative to the node **nodeId**. Folders in the **relativePath** that do not exist are created before the node is created.  You can set properties when you create a new node: ```JSON {   \"name\":\"My Other Folder\",   \"nodeType\":\"cm:folder\",   \"properties\":   {     \"cm:title\":\"Folder title\",     \"cm:description\":\"This is an important folder\"   } } ```  You can set multi-value properties when you create a new node which supports properties of type multiple.  ```JSON {   \"name\":\"My Other Folder\",   \"nodeType\":\"custom:destination\",   \"properties\":   {     \"cm:title\":\"Folder title\",     \"cm:description\":\"This is an important folder\",     \"custom:locations\": [                          \"location X\",                          \"location Y\"                         ]   } } ```  Any missing aspects are applied automatically. For example, **cm:titled** in the JSON shown above. You can set aspects explicitly, if needed, using an **aspectNames** field.  **Note:** setting properties of type d:content and d:category are not supported.  You can also optionally disable (or enable) inherited permissions via *isInheritanceEnabled* flag: ```JSON {   \"permissions\":     {       \"isInheritanceEnabled\": false,       \"locallySet\":         [           {\"authorityId\": \"GROUP_special\", \"name\": \"Read\", \"accessStatus\":\"DENIED\"},           {\"authorityId\": \"testuser\", \"name\": \"Contributor\", \"accessStatus\":\"ALLOWED\"}         ]     } } ```  Typically, for files and folders, the primary children are created within the parent folder using the default \"cm:contains\" assocType. If the content model allows then it is also possible to create primary children with a different assoc type. For example: ```JSON {   \"name\":\"My Node\",   \"nodeType\":\"my:specialNodeType\",   \"association\":   {     \"assocType\":\"my:specialAssocType\"   } } ```  Additional associations can be added after creating a node. You can also add associations at the time the node is created. This is required, for example, if the content model specifies that a node has mandatory associations to one or more existing nodes. You can optionally specify an array of **secondaryChildren** to create one or more secondary child associations, such that the newly created node acts as a parent node. You can optionally specify an array of **targets** to create one or more peer associations such that the newly created node acts as a source node. For example, to associate one or more secondary children at time of creation: ```JSON {   \"name\":\"My Folder\",   \"nodeType\":\"cm:folder\",   \"secondaryChildren\":     [ {\"childId\":\"abcde-01234-...\", \"assocType\":\"my:specialChildAssocType\"} ] } ``` For example, to associate one or more targets at time of creation: ```JSON {   \"name\":\"My Folder\",   \"nodeType\":\"cm:folder\",   \"targets\":     [ {\"targetId\":\"abcde-01234-...\", \"assocType\":\"my:specialPeerAssocType\"} ] } ```  **Note:** You can create more than one child by specifying a list of nodes in the JSON body. For example, the following JSON body creates two folders inside the specified **nodeId**, if the **nodeId** identifies a folder:  ```JSON [   {     \"name\":\"My Folder 1\",     \"nodeType\":\"cm:folder\"   },   {     \"name\":\"My Folder 2\",     \"nodeType\":\"cm:folder\"   } ] ``` If you specify a list as input, then a paginated list rather than an entry is returned in the response body. For example:  ```JSON {   \"list\": {     \"pagination\": {       \"count\": 2,       \"hasMoreItems\": false,       \"totalItems\": 2,       \"skipCount\": 0,       \"maxItems\": 100     },     \"entries\": [       {         \"entry\": {           ...         }       },       {         \"entry\": {           ...         }       }     ]   } } ``` **Note:** When creating a new node using JSON by default versioning is disabled. Since Alfresco 6.2.3 **versioningEnabled** flag was introduced offering better control over the new node Versioning.  | **versioningEnabled** | **majorVersion** | **Version Type** | |-----------------------|------------------|------------------| |        unset          |        unset     |    Unversioned   | |        unset          |        true      |    MAJOR         | |        unset          |        false     |    MINOR         | |        true           |        unset     |    MAJOR         | |        true           |        true      |    MAJOR         | |        true           |        false     |    MINOR         | |        false          |        true      |    Unversioned   | |        false          |        false     |    Unversioned   | |        false          |        true      |    Unversioned   | <br> ", response = NodeEntry.class, authorizations = {
